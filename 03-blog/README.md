# Blog

This section aims to help us learn how to work with Markdown and MDX files in our project, which are commonly used in Astro projects. In this section, we will continue working with collections, but we'll add relationships to identify the authors of each entry.

Specifically, we will cover:

-   MD and MDX
-   Blog-style layout
-   Reading the file system to get entries
-   Astro Collections
-   Filters in collections
-   Image component
-   Formats
-   Resolutions
-   ResourceSets
-   Images for collections
-   Zod â€“ Schema validator
-   Collection types
